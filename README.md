Minecraft-Launcher
==================
This is a very early version of my Minecraft Launcher

I will be using Tomsik68's [Minecraft Launcher API](https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api)

TODO
==================
- [x] Create Basic GUI (Doesn't need to be fancy, yet)
- [   ] Login(Working On)
- [   ] Launching the Game(The API only starts versions prior to 1.6)
- [   ] Launch versions 1.6 and higher
- [   ] Use profiles and have ability to use multiple accounts
- [   ] Check Mojang Server Statuses at startup
